## Input files

Small input data files are stored directly in this Github repository in the `data` subfolder. 
There is two larger data files (> 150MB) which are stored through the Git Large File Storage System (git lfs) and these will not download automatically with a `git pull` command. We recommend to download these files with your browser. In principle, you can also download them by activating the git lfs in your local git folder, but we have had bad experiences with this tool and the manual download avoids that. 

## Output files

For demonstration, we also include the output files generated by the code in the folder `output`. These will be overwritten as you run the notebooks, but we decided to include them in case you want to re-use the trait dataset directly.

## Python environment

This code runs with Python Python 3.7.13 and requires a list of packages. You can install them with `pip -r requirements.txt`.:

## Python scripts

We note that some of the python scripts in this folder are actually an output of the jupyter notebooks. As you run the notebooks (e.g. `00_develop_pairwise_simulation_code.ipynb`), this will generate `.py` file from scratch.
